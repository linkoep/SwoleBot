# SwoleBot
Created at BostonHacks2019. A GroupMe Bot (among other things) that helps our frisbee team stay motivated to work out

## Contributing
Have Matt Brown or Linus Koepfer add you to the Google Cloud Project. The `develop` branch is the default branch, and a test groupme runs off of this branch. When a feature has been fully tested on `develop`, it can be merged to `master`, which runs the bot in the actual workout GroupMe.
